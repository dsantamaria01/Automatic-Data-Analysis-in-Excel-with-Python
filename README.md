# Data-Analysis-in-Excel-with-Python

Welcome,

In this code we parse a list of KPI items within different Excel files, and then enter the results into a new file created using the format of a third file.
We will also use data within a web to be able to organize and complete correctly all the data. It would be the union of different libraries in the search for a fully automated completion of the analysis task.
Different methods will be used to perform the proposed analysis following standard KPI validation parameters.


We will use libraries such as: Pandas for data analysis, Selenium to take the necessary data from the web, and libraries such as openpyxl that will allow us to use .xls files.
